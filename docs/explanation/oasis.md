The software that runs NOMAD is Open-Source and can be used independently of the NOMAD
*central installation* at [http://nomad-lab.eu](http://nomad-lab.eu){:target="_blank"}.
We call any NOMAD installation that is not the *central* one a NOMAD Oasis.

There are several use-cases how the NOMAD software could be used. Of course other
uses and hybrids are imaginable:

- Academia: Use the Oasis for local management of unpublished research data
- Mirror: Use the Oasis as a mirror that hosts a copy of all published NOMAD data
- Industry: Use of Oasis to manage private data and full internal use of published data in compliance with strict privacy policies
- FAIRmat: Use Oasis to form a network of repositories to build a federated data infrastructure
for materials science.
This is what we do in the [FAIRmat project](https://www.fair-di.eu/fairmat/consortium){:target="_blank"}.
