This tutorial shows how to use NOMAD's search interface and structured data browsing to explore available data.

!!! note
    The NOMAD seen in the tutorials is an older version with a different color theme,
    but all the demonstrated functionality is still available on the current version.
    You'll find the NOMAD test installation mentioned in the first video
